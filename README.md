# NLP-Topic-Modeling-LDA
In this notebook, I will use the Olist e-commerce dataset to perform a topic modeling analysis on customer reviews to find out what are the main topics that customers talk about in their reviews.

For that analysis, I will be using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) in order to find the hidden topics within the text data. LDA is a type of probability distribution (i.e. every document is a probability distribution of topics, and every topic is a probability distribution of words).

I will be comparing two types of LDA models, the multicore and the mallet, to see which model performs better in extracting the topics from the documents/text data (the performance metrics that I will assess are perplexity and coherence scores).
